The effort being put in automating tests should not take over delivering value to users. Frisbee makes it possible to:

- Setup initial dependency stack â€“ easily!

- Test against actual, close to production software - no mocks!

- Replay complex workloads written in an intuitive language!

- Combine Chaos Engineering with large-scale performance testing!

- Assert actual program behavior and side effects

Below you will find some of the most common and helpful pages from our documentation.
