      <description>Frisbee Overview Frisbee is an open source cloud-native platform intended for engineers and researchers looking to explore, test, and benchmark distributed applications faster and more reliably. It offers various types of fault simulation and has an enormous capability to orchestrate complex scenarios in the domains of:
Cloud Databases Federated Learning Frameworks Telecommunication services Blockchain applications IoT applications Frisbee is implemented as a Kubernetes CRD (Custom Resource Definition). As a result, Frisbee workflows can be managed using kubectl and natively integrates with other Kubernetes services such as volumes, secrets, and RBAC.</description>

      <title>Basic Concepts</title>

      <description>This document describes the basic features of Frisbee, including Templates, Actions, Scenarios, Visualized Operations, and Security Guarantees.
Templates Templates define minimally constraining skeletons for Services and Faults. When called without parameters, templates generate services initialized with reasonable defaults. With parameters, templates generate the customized configuration by replacing the placeholders (denoted as {{...}}) with the given input. Unlike other engines that evaluate templates at deployment time, Frisbee evaluates them at runtime. This strategy allows us to create a library of frequently-used specifications and use them to generate objects on-demand throughout the experiment.</description>

      <description>This document describes how to quickly start Frisbee in a test or local environment.
Step 1. Environment preparation Please ensure that the Kubernetes cluster and Helm package manager are deployed before the trial. If they are, go to Step 2.
# Install microk8s v.1.24 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; sudo snap install microk8s --classic --channel=1.24/stable # Use microk8s config as the default kubernetes config &amp;gt;&amp;gt; microk8s config &amp;gt; ~/.kube/config # Start microk8s &amp;gt;&amp;gt; microk8s start # Enable Dependencies &amp;gt;&amp;gt; microk8s enable dns ingress helm3 # Create aliases &amp;gt;&amp;gt; sudo snap alias microk8s.</description>
